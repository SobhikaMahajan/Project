This repository contains the solution to Data Analysis problem statement of Microsoft Engage 2022.

Microsoft Car Finder helps to analyze and visualise automative dataset and also predict selling car price and mileage. This solves the problem of a user who wishes to analyze his car or wants to know the selling car price/mileage of his/her car.

The tech-stack which I used in this project are:
1) Python and its libraries
2) Streamlit(python framework)

Requirements:
1) matplotlib==3.5.1
2) numpy==1.22.3
3) pandas==1.4.2
4) plotly==5.8.0
5) plotly-express==0.4.1
6) seaborn==0.11.2
7) streamlit==1.9.0
8) streamlit-lottie==0.0.3
9) streamlit-option-menu==0.3.2
10) matplotlib-inline==0.1.3
11) pydeck==0.7.1
12) statsmodels==4.9.2
13) scipy==1.4.1

Starting with a beautiful landing page, the user heads next to a page with navigation bar. The navigation bar has the takes us to three dashboard namely Car Dashboard, Mileage Predictor and Price Predictor.

Car Dashboard contains all the EDA done on the car dataset. It has several categories for easy access.
Mileage Predictor contains several input boxes for the user to input values. Based on the input prediction model predicts and gives estimated mileage.
Price Predictor also contains several input boxes for the user to input values. Based on the input prediction model predicts and gives estimated selling price the user will get.
